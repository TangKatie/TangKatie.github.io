            <em>Major: Cognitive Science | Year: Freshmen</em>
            <p>Hello, this is Katie. I come from SoCal, specifically from San Gabriel Valley. 
                I love to eat, sleep, and play games. Very normal student like behavior. 
                Sometimes if I don't feel like doing work, I would draw instead. 
                This happens very rarely though because I am cleary a very academic student.</p>
