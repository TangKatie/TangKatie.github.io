							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>

								I've never thought of font pairing, so learning about it in this article encouraged me to consider it in future designs. 
								There is a golden ratio to font sizes and learning this could help me determine the best sizes for each header.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the golden ratio for font sizes section.
